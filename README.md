# lib_papers

This is a simple Twitter and Mastodon bot that tweets satirical and mostly non-sensical library conference paper titles.

The main file is fairly heavily commented so you should be able to follow along by reading the code. It uses a pre-populated list of cliche phrases, the top ten Twitter trending terms in Australia, Wikipedia article titles, and some random nouns, and mixes them up to create new conference paper topics. It them chooses from these at random to create a conference paper title. Every 5 hours you get a new tweet/toot.

This is version 3.0, completely rewritten to use a new source (Wikipedia instead of Reuters), new phrases, and cleaner code. Now licensed GPL 3.0+ (as of v3)
